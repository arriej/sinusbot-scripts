# sinusbot scripts

This is a fork of the original work of Jonas Bögle (irgendwr).
I'm not planning to maintain these scripts. But more or less add some features i'd personally like on existing scripts.
Im a noob when it comes to javascript but lets give it a try.  


This repository includes a few scripts that Jonas Bögle (irgendwr) wrote for the [SinusBot](https://sinusbot.com).

## Installation

1. Download the script and put it in the scripts folder where the SinusBot is installed
2. Restart the SinusBot
3. Go to your web-interface: Settings -> Scrips and enable the script by checking the box next to it
4. Configure the script as you like (by clicking on the arrow to show the options and pressing 'save' at the end)
5. Click on Save changes at the bottom of the page

## Scripts

Hi {mention}, your ID is: {uid} and you have the following {client_groups_count} groups: {client_groups}.
Random number between 0 and 100: {random(1, 100)}.
```

## Troubleshooting

- make sure that you have the latest version of the SinusBot (some scripts require at least version 1.0.0)
- make sure that you have the latest version of this script
- read the instructions above carefully and check if you've missed anything
- If you've checked everything and it still doesn't work then you can ask for help in the discussion thread or open an issue on GitHub.
  But hold on for a second! Before you post: [read this first](https://forum.sinusbot.com/threads/read-me-before-you-post.342/) and include all of the required information.
